COMP3203 Final Project Readme
------------------------------

Included in this zip file are:
	-The project source files
	-An executable .jar file
	-LogFile

Notes on the source code:
	In the source code we have the following files:
		-Beacon 
		-Client -> If the source code gives you an error when trying to run it, choose to run this file as the java application
		-CreateGraph
		-DataComponent
		-Display
		-View

	In the Client class, you can adjust the max number of beacons allowed, the max radius, and the sample size to your desired values

Notes on the LogFile:
	-If the logfile is opened in Eclipse, it will be formatted an easily readable - a normal text editor may distort the format.
	-The log file data is appended each time, so if you would like to see fresh data only, clear the log file or simply delete it before running.

If no changes are desired the executable functions as is, with max_beacons of 200, max_radius of 20 and sample size of 20.
